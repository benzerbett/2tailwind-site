import Alert from '../../components/Alert'

Windmill React UI uses a default theme under the hood to provide you a concise, but still flexible styling experience. You can find the entire file [here](https://github.com/estevanmaito/windmill-react-ui/blob/master/src/themes/default.ts).

You can reference it in your code importing the default theme `@windmill/react-ui/lib/defaultTheme`.

## Customize the default theme

To change a specific style, create a file in your project and add the properties you want to change (see [all available styles](https://github.com/estevanmaito/windmill-react-ui/blob/master/src/themes/default.ts)):

```js title=myTheme.js
export default {
  button: {
    size: {
      regular: 'px-4 py-2 text-sm',
    },
  },
}
```

<Alert>
  Note that you only need to specify the values you are changing within your theme. It will be
  merged together with the default theme automtically.
</Alert>

Then pass it to the `Windmill` component that is enclosing your root components, using the prop `theme`.

```jsx title=App.js
import { Windmill } from '@windmill/react-ui'
import myTheme from './myTheme.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Windmill theme={myTheme}>
    <App />
  </Windmill>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

As a side note, you still need to pass your theme file to Purge to make sure your styles will appear in the production build.
