import Alert from '../../components/Alert'

Windmill, when used with the prop `usePreferences` on the enclosing `Windmill` component, offers out of the box the following features:

- Theme toggler to switch between themes
- `prefers-color-scheme` support to automatically change to dark theme if user prefers 'dark'
- `localStorage` storing for user preferences so it's consistent on every visit/load

## Add a toggle theme button

In Windmill, multi theme is part of the core, so to make it easier for you to change between styles, it exposes a way for you to toggle and to read the current theme through React's Context API, as long as you have `Windmill` enclosing your root component with the `usePreferences` prop.

Simply import `WindmillContext` and destructure `mode` (current selected mode) and `toggleMode` (toggle between light and dark).

<Alert>It will only work if you use the usePreferences prop on the root Windmill component.</Alert>

```jsx title=SomeComponent.js
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { Button, WindmillContext } from '@windmill/react-ui'

function SomeComponent() {
  const { mode, toggleMode } = useContext(WindmillContext)

  return (
    <Button onClick={toggleMode}>Toggle theme</Button>
    <p>Current theme is: {mode}</p>
  )
}

export default SomeComponent
```

## Dark as default

The default theme is light, but if you want to make the dark theme standard, add the prop `dark` to your `Windmill` component,

```jsx title=App.js
import { Windmill } from '@windmill/react-ui'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Windmill dark>
    <App />
  </Windmill>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Dark theme in your own project

Tailwind does not support dark themes yet (last version `1.4.6`), but it is possible to use in this project thanks to [tailwindcss-multi-theme](https://github.com/estevanmaito/tailwindcss-multi-theme/blob/master/README.md#-install).

It extends Tailwind styles by adding `dark:` in front of every utility (you can read more in the simple docs in the link above), and is available for you to use by the plugin you added in [Installation](installation), as long as you are using the `Windmill` component to encapsulate your root component.

### Recommendations

Windmill UI uses a modified color palette, based on Tailwind UI. The biggest difference you will notice is that the original Tailwind CSS gray is now under `cool-gray` like `bg-cool-gray-500`, while the actual `gray` is a little bit darker from `700` on. You may think that it looks almost black or that they are almost the same, and for text, it may be hard to distinguish between them.

The difference is that when you are coloring large parts of the screen (eg. a dark theme with large dark parts) the original palette have too much contrast, while the colors we use here fit better for this kind of usage.

Recommendation #1: Think of your design as if there were layers: elements closer to the user should use a lighter gray while farther ones should use darker shades. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/1151160261170126850/photo/1) from Steve Schoger shows it better than words.
