import Alert from '../../../components/Alert'

This page condensates information about the `Windmill` component that you may have already seen in [Dark theme](dark-theme), [Installation](installation) and [Customization](customization), but gives more details.

## Import

```jsx
import { Windmill } from '@windmill/react-ui'
```

## Base

The default `Windmill` component must encapsulate your root component and it doesn't apply any changes by default.

<Alert>This is only recommended if you just want to provide a single light theme.</Alert>

```jsx title=App.js
<Windmill>
  <App />
</Windmill>
```

## Use preferences

The `usePreferences` prop enables these features:

- Theme toggler to switch between themes ([read more](/react-ui/dark-theme#add-a-toggle-theme-button) about it)
- `prefers-color-scheme` support to automatically change to dark theme if user prefers 'dark'
- `localStorage` storing for user preferences so it's consistent on every visit/load

All of it taken care with a single prop...

```jsx title=App.js
<Windmill usePreferences>
  <App />
</Windmill>
```

## Dark as default

The `dark` prop turns the dark theme the default.

```jsx title=App.js
<Windmill dark>
  <App />
</Windmill>
```

## Custom theme

You can merge a custom theme (that is, you don't need to create a complete theme, just changing little bits is enough) using the `theme` prop.

Learn how to do it on [Customization](/react-ui/customization).

```jsx title=App.js
<Windmill theme={myTheme}>
  <App />
</Windmill>
```
