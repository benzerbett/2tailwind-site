import TransitionExample from '../../../components/TransitionExample'

This component is a wrapper around `react-transition-group` that makes is it easy to create transitions using Tailwind CSS classes.

## Import

```jsx
import { Transition } from '@windmill/react-ui'
```

## Basics

Take a look at this compressed example.

<TransitionExample />

```jsx
<Transition
  show={isOpen}
  enter="transition ease-out duration-100 transform"
  enterFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
  enterTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
  leave="transition ease-in duration-75 transform"
  leaveFrom="opacity-100 scale-100"
  leaveTo="opacity-0 scale-95"
>
  <div className="absolute left-0 w-56 mt-2 rounded-md shadow-lg">
    <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded-md shadow-xs">Hi</div>
  </div>
</Transition>
```

## Show

The `show` prop defines the visibility of the components inside the `Transition` and starts the animations.

```jsx
<Transition show={isOpen}>...</Transition>
```

## Transition timings

There are six transition timings available: `enter`, `enterFrom`, `enterTo`, `leave`, `leaveFrom` and `leaveTo`.

- `enter`: styles that will control the entire enter (appearing) phase
- `enterFrom`: styles to start from
- `enterTo`: end result styles
- `leave`: styles that will control the entire leave (disappearing) phase
- `leaveFrom`: styles to start from (you would usually 'leave from' where you 'entered to')
- `leaveTo`: end result styles (you would usually 'leave to' where you 'entered from')

```jsx
<Transition
  show={isOpen}
  enter="transition ease-out duration-100 transform"
  enterFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
  enterTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
  leave="transition ease-in duration-75 transform"
  leaveFrom="opacity-100 scale-100"
  leaveTo="opacity-0 scale-95"
>
  ...
</Transition>
```

## Composition

There will be times where you need two components transitioning at the same time, based on the same condition.

Take the example below, extracted from the `MobileSidebar` of the [Windmill Dashboard React](/dashboard-react). The `Backdrop` should just appear (fade), while the sidebar should slide from the left.

In this case we use a root transition that will control all inner transitions with a single `show` prop. Note that the inner `Transition`s don't have a `show` prop, only the styles to be applied.

```jsx
<Transition show={isSidebarOpen}>
  <>
    <Transition
      enter="transition ease-in-out duration-150"
      enterFrom="opacity-0"
      enterTo="opacity-100"
      leave="transition ease-in-out duration-150"
      leaveFrom="opacity-100"
      leaveTo="opacity-0"
    >
      <Backdrop onClick={closeSidebar} />
    </Transition>

    <Transition
      enter="transition ease-in-out duration-150"
      enterFrom="opacity-0 transform -translate-x-20"
      enterTo="opacity-100"
      leave="transition ease-in-out duration-150"
      leaveFrom="opacity-100"
      leaveTo="opacity-0 transform -translate-x-20"
    >
      <aside className="fixed inset-y-0 z-30 flex-shrink-0 w-64 mt-16 overflow-y-auto bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:hidden">
        <SidebarContent />
      </aside>
    </Transition>
  </>
</Transition>
```
